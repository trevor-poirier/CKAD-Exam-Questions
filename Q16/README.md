[Servicing and Networking | 20% Weight | 6.3 pts]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You have rolled out a new Pod to your infrastructure and now you need to allow it
to communicate with the web and storage Pods but nothing else - while maintaining
network security. Given the running Pod "ckad0021-newpod", edit it to use a 
NetworkPolicy that will allow it to send and receive traffic only to and from 
the web and storage Pods.

All work on this item should be conducted in the ckad0021 Namespace.

All required NetworkPolicy resources are already created and ready for use as 
appropriate. You should not create, modify or delete any network policies whilst
completing this item.
