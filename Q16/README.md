~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You have rolled out a new pod "ckad0021-newpod" on your Kubernetes cluster under
the NS ckad0021. Now, you need to strengthen the network security. A network policy 
exists already. 

Your task is to update the existing NetworkPolicy to allow the newly created 
pod "ckad0021-newpod" to send and receive traffic from web and storage pods only.
